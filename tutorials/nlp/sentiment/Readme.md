## Pre-requisites
Anaconda was already installed on my system. It makes the installation of packages and libraries much easier. So I suggest you to do the same. The version is not important at first. Just get the [current version](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and you are good to go.

## Environment

<!-- In the config section you can find the [myenvironment.yml](https://github.com/hadze/machinelearning/blob/master/tutorials/nlp/word_embedding/config/myenvironment.yml) file containing the needed packages and libraries for this example. Basically I have used 
  - python=3.7.9
  - gensim=3.8.0
  - tensorboard==1.12.2
  - tensorflow==1.13.0rc1
 -->
You just have to execute the following steps to get the needed environment running on your system:

* Open terminal or console application on your system
* Create conda environment and install all needed packages: **conda env create -f myenvironment.yml**
