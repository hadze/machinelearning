# machinelearning
This repository contains some [tutorials](https://github.com/hadze/machinelearning/tree/master/tutorials) I programmed to learn more about MachineLearning topics as well as some basic concepts in the same area. I hope you find it useful. Currently I am busy creating a ML framework to be able to react faster to requests and competitions. More about this soon... 

## dockerfile
This Dockerfile contains the environment which is used and proposed by kaggle for general competitions. If you don't want to use the "all-round" variant, I have also created some yaml files in the subfolders, which only contain the minimal config of required libraries.

## kaggle competitions
More about this soon, too...
