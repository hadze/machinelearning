This repository contains some [tutorials](https://github.com/hadze/machinelearning/tree/master/tutorials) I programmed to learn more about MachineLearning topics as well as some basic concepts in the same area. I hope you find it useful. Currently I am busy creating a ML framework to be able to react faster to requests and competitions. More about this soon...
